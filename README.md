# Song Management System using React.js

## Project Description
This project aims to develop a song management system that will provide users with a comprehensive platform to manage their music collection. 
The system will be built using React.js, a popular and efficient frontend development tool, and MySQL, a robust and reliable relational database management system. 
The system will have user management functionality, which will allow users to register, login, and manage their account details. 
Song management functionality will also be incorporated into the system, which will enable users to upload, delete, and edit their music files. 
Additionally, the system will have artist management functionality, which will allow users to add and manage information related to their favorite artists. 
With this song management system, users can easily organize their music collection and have seamless access to their favorite songs and artists.
